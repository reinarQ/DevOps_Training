# Kubernetes - On the road to production !

Module: **Orchestration** </br>
Competency: is able to deploy a k8s production ready cluster <br />
Duration: **2 days** </br>
Participant(s): **solo** </br>

## Introduction

Deploying the Kubernetes cluster manually can be a daunting task and generally not recommended. To simplify and facilitate the deployment process there are some tools, ones that are widely used are kops, kubeadm, kubespray.

All of these are managed, developed, and supported by the Kubernetes community.

In this challenge we will focus on KubeSpray which gives a simple and easy way to install a multi-master, production-ready HA cluster for deploying any business-critical applications. Kubespray is using Ansible playbooks, inventory, provisioning tools, to deploy Kubernetes. It can be used to deploy k8s clusters on cloud or on-premise.

## The mission

As you have probably already understood, your mission for the day is to deploy a multi-nodes kubernetes cluster with the help of kubespray in your local machine with the help of vagrant & ansible. Once you have accomplished this first task, you will have to deploy an application (of your choice) on your newly created cluster and configure the deployment of this application so that it has several replicas which will then run on the different nodes in your cluster.
