# The Summer Pasture
## Description

The "Summer Pasture" is conceptually very simple, an almost two months long period to independently prepare for the coming internship, but it might as well be considered one of the hardest part of the training. Indeed, and although the coaches will remain available to answer questions and offer guidance, the trainees will mostly be on their own to find content to work on while the coaches focus primarily on ensuring everyone finds an internship. This amount of freedom is a double edged sword as with it comes responsibility. Responsibility to be productive, to actively seek solutions and most importantly to keep on learning.

At BeCode we feel that giving this amount of influence to the trainees over the end of their training is paramount for them to become self-reliant problem solver as well as continuous learners. Qualities we perceive to be essential to an IT career in a DevOps enabled company.
