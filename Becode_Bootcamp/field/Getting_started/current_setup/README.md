# Current setup
## Description
I decided to fully immerse myself in the Linus OS environnment after working a while with WSL and Debian (VM in VPN) I felt limited in WSL and also encountered many issues with p.e. vagrant or that the program would abruptly freeze causing me to force-quit and lose some of the work I was doing.

A friend recommended Fedora and I am very satisfied with this distro.
