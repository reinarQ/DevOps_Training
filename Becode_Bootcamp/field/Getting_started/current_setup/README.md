# Current setup
## Description
I decided to fully immerse myself in the Linus OS environnment after working a while with WSL and Debian (VM in VPN) I felt limited in WSL and also encountered many issues with p.e. vagrant or that the program would abruptly freeze causing me to force-quit and lose some of the work I was doing.

A friend recommended Fedora and I am very satisfied with this distro. 

## Dual Boot
I choose to Dual Boot first, but am mainly using Fedora.

Dual Boot is when you run two operating systems on one computer at the same time. This can be any combination of operating systems.

## Tmux
Tmux stands for "terminal multiplexer‚Äù. This means you can open multiple split-views (panes) in a single terminal window, and each will function as its own independent terminal. They run visually, right next to each other, eliminating the need to open a new window.

Tmux helped me save my work whenever WSL froze, I just had to reopen last session and have my terminals opened again where I left.

I've added this tool in search of a more efficient workflow = better overview of tasks and information.


## Taskwarrior

Taskwarrior is a terminal based Todo application. 

This keeps me keeping track of the things I need to do in my working the terminal environment in order to streamline my workflow.
