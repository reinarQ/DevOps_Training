# The Mountain
## Description

The "mountain" is a trial of might, a 25 days long project encompassing all, or almost all, of the concepts and technologies seen during the training. It acts as a consolidation phase to connect the acquired competencies and pieces of knowledge in a global understanding of the DevOps technical landscape.

The project itself will tackle the entire lifecycle of a microservices based application, minus the development phases. Indeed, it will be the trainees responsibilities to setup a pipeline that is able to receive new code, test it and then deploy it to an infrastructure that is easily monitorable, scalable as well as reproducible using the technologies seen during "The Hill".

At the end of this project the trainees should have a something demonstrable, stored as a repository, that can be added to their portfolio to showcase there newly acquired competencies.
