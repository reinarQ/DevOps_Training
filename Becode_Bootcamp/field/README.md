# The Field
## Description

The "Field"'s goal is to provide the core knowledge and competency a system administrator aiming to train in the "/DevOps way/" should have. Furthermore, it acts as an introduction to the BeCode methodology and learning philosophy; in other words it's also a trial period for the trainees to test whether the approach fits them, or not.

It will last 30 days and has the peculiarity of being the most guided section of the training. Indeed, and in contrast to the rest of the course, its content will be tackled in a pre-defined order and will be complemented by talks (given by the coaches) as well as systematic feedback (otherwise has to be requested) to ensure solid foundation to move on. Concretely the Field translates to the following timeline:

    - Setup local working environment.
    - Learn how to use versioning with  Git and complement its workflow with Github.
    - Learn how to administer Linux systems and deploy services on them.
    - Perform common tasks (file management, process management, text manipulation, firewall, ...)
    - Install software, services and applications.
    - Monitor systems health (network, performance, ...)
    - Write shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
    - Work on a deployment project given an undocumented web application.

Ultimately, the knowledge and skills acquired during the Field will serve as the basis upon which trainees will further explore the tooling associated with DevOps.
