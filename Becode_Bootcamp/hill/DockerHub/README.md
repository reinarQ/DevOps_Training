# Docker - DockerHub

Type of challenge: **learning** </br>
Duration: **1 day** </br>
Team challenge : **solo**

The easiest way to package your code for production is by using a container image. DokerHub is like Github for container images, you can upload and share with others an unlimited amount of publicly available dockerized applications at no cost. In today's challenge we will learn about DockerHub, how to use it, how to create our own image, and publishing and pulling images to and from Docker Hub.

## The mission

As a newly hired DevOps Engineer at a compagny called PetClinic. The company has a new website that has been written in Java. Given this [Github Repo](https://github.com/g0t4/jgsu-spring-petclinic), you have been asked to containerize the application within a docker image and publish the produced image to DockerHub registry in order to facilitate the deployment of future releases.

To help you achieve that goal, here are some of the steps you should go through:

- Make a new Github repository with the content of the original [Repo](https://github.com/g0t4/jgsu-spring-petclinic)
- Create a DockerHub account.
- Log in to DockerHub from your Terminal.
- Craft a Dockerfile.
- Run the tests and build the artifact.
- Build the Docker image.
- Tag your image.
- Push your image to Dockerhub.
- Pull your image from Dockerhub and run a container localy.
