## Introduction

Grafana is a database analysis and monitoring tool. It allows you to create dashboard visualizations of key metrics that are important to you. Grafana supports a huge number of sources of data such as Graphite, Prometheus, Influx DB, Elastic Search, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

The combination of Prometheus & Grafana is the de-fact tool combination in the industry for deploying a data visualisation setup.

## The mission

For your today's mission, you will have to setup a Grafana instance somewhere and add your own prometheus data source to it.

Once you've done that, you will have to download and install a full NodeExporter dashboard so that you can visualize all the metrics from all your prometheus targets.

To finish, try to build your own custom dashboard, so that you can visualise only metrics that are important to you.
