# Terraform Practical - AWS

Module: **Infrastructure As Code** </br>
Competency: is able to use terraform to deploy resources on the AWS cloud.</br>
Duration: **1 days** </br>
Participant(s): **solo** </br>

## The mission

Now that you have a better understanding of the concepts behind terraform. I suggest you apply them through practical tutorials that will allow you to deploy resources in the AWS cloud.
Today your mission will be to:

As a first step you will have to follow theses [series of  tutorials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started) found in the terraform documentation about deploying an EC2 instance in AWS. That said, this tutorial being really simple, too simple in my opinion, it does not take into account the creation of VPC, private Subnet, public Subnet, Internet Gateway, CIDR blocks and Security groups. This is why...

As a second step, you will have to follow [this second tutorial](https://awstip.com/how-to-create-custom-ec2-vpcs-in-aws-using-terraform-df647fc36503), in which all these concepts specific to the AWS cloud are mentioned.

One last thing, when following these tutorials it will be very easy to just copy/paste the code examples... and that's is not a issue on it's own. However... please try to understand what you are doing and make sure you understand every single peace of the code your are copy/pasting... if you don't understand something, do a research about it.


### **IMPORTANT Note:**

- It's important to make sure you are using the t2.micro instance type when depying an EC2 to minimize the costs.
- Please destory all you resources (terraform destroy) at the end of the day to make sure you will not pay unecessary extra fee (public ip, etc....).
