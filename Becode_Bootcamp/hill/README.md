# The Hill
## Description

The "Hill" solely focuses on preparing the trainees to face real, modern DevOps projects. In order to do that, and for 100 days, they will have to practice a concrete technology stack comprised of common DevOps associated tools and understand their underlying concepts. The stack goes as follow:

    Golang (/programming language/), Nginx (/web server/), Gitlab CI (/CI/CD/)
    Vagrant (/vm provisioning/), Docker-Compose (/application container/), Kubernetes (/container orchestration/)
    SonarQube (/code analyzer/), Grafana or Prometheus (/infrastructure monitoring/), Elastic Stack (/logs management/)
    Ansible (/configuration management/), Terraform (/infrastructure provisioning/)
    Azure (/cloud provider/), Hashicorp (/secret management/)

In practice this section will provide challenges (practical learning opportunities) centered on the stack described above, as well as a proposed roadmap to tackle it "efficiently". During this phase, the coaches will actively engage with the trainees to see how healthy their learning process is, but overall they'll be able to tackle and complement the content as they see fit, as long as they focus on acquiring competency in the desired technology stack.

Indeed, and although we'll work on a specific technology stack, we'll always prioritize understanding core concepts to mindlessly learning tools for specific situations. In other words, we want trainee to be able to adapt and use their acquired competencies regardless of a project's circumstances or, given enough time, specific tools.
